# PowerPoint Notes

## Content tips

- Presentations should not go over 20 pages (5-10 for this presentation)
- Use sentence case for Title and Subtitle on Cover slide as well as slide headings
- Avoid text-heavy slides
- Minimal text
  - Avoid paragraphs
  - Use key phrases / words
  - More slides to break up text
  - When feasible use a graphic - icon or image - to make point instead of text

## Design tips

- Allow for white space
- Use images/ graphics to reinforce messaging, not to fill empty space
- NO detailed graphics
- Don't use clip art
- Obtain rights / permission for images and graphics from an external provider
- Limit the number of colors used on a slide.
- Avoid unnecessary information; every element on a slide should have a purpose.

## Color

- **White**: main canvas, helps images and cornerstones standout
- **Gradients**:  cornerstones, occasional color blocks and occasionally in type
- **Red**:  primary color and it is part of both gradients. It’s used for the logo and can be used on type to highlight information, such as calls to action and small titles. It is never used as a solid color in color blocks or in cornerstones
- **Black** is the main typography color. It is never used as a solid color in color blocks or in cornerstones.
- **Purple** is used for links in digital applications and some titles within our templates. It is never used as a solid color in color blocks or in cornerstones. Its main use should be within the gradient.

## White space

- White space is any section in your document that is not used.
- We use white space as much as possible in our visuals because it’s proven to attract an audience and help them understand a message.
- When we have less information, less colors and less imagery, our communications become distinctive among the competition and our audience is able to focus on the most important areas of our message.
- when you look at the whole document, it should include a lot of white.
- This doesn't mean that an individual slide or brochure page can’t have a lot of colors; rather, the entire composition should provide enough white space to provide levity to the reader or viewer.
