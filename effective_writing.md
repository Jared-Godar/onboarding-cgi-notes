# Writing Best Practices and Resources

At CGI, we have a **powerful story** to share. We tell that story best when we bring clarity of thought to our writing.

> *"Clarity of writing usually follows clarity of thought." -The Economist Style Guide*

## 10 tips for effective writing

1. **Make a plan**

- Plan message before writing
  - Audience
  - Why they should care
  - Desired response
- Make an outline

2. **Tell a story**

- Stories engage readers
- Beginning, middle, end
- Capture attention (then get straight to the point)
- Build in body
- Provide strong conclusion
- Anecdotes, statistics, quotes, case studies, and other engaging information

3. **Apply our tone of voice**

- *Straightforward* Simplify complexity
- *Collaborative* Work alongside clients as hands-on problem solvers
- *Empathetic* View things from clients' perspectives
- *Proven* Strong and stable company with a track record of helping clients achieve sustainable results

4. **Use active voice**

5. **Keep it simple**

- Short sentences
- Familiar words
- Clean syntax
- Don't force the reader to use too much brainpower to understand your meaning
- Even though we work in a technical field, don't fall to the temptation to use technical terms to display expertise
- The harder the reader has to try to understand you, the more likely they are to stop trying
- Avoid acronyms and industry terms that could confuse
- If you must, take the time to explain them

6. **Be short and sweet**

> *"Never use a long word where a short one will do." -Orwell*

- Same for long sentences and paragraphs. Every extra word, phrase, and paragraph gives readers another reason to get distracted

> *If it is possible to cut out a word, always cut it out." -Ibid.*

- Readers will stay engaged if your writing is easy to consume
- If you need a longer sentence, mix it with shorter ones

7. **Be specific**

- "We work with many utility companies" vs. "We  work with more than 250 electric, gas, and water companies worldwide."

8. **Add a human touch**

- You, I, we
- Human impact of technology solution
- Anecdotes

9. **Stay positive and humble**

- People business
- Empathetic and inclusive
- Share strengths without insulting competitors
- Don't come across as telling clients what to do

10. **Polish and perfect**

- Edit and re-read multiple times
- Cut extra words
- Catch passive voice
- Clarify meaning
- Leave "cold" and revisit later
- New reader
