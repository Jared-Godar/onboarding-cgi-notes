### Role in vision (Dr. Sonia Lupien)

- Founder and Director Centre for Studies on Human Stress
- Stress causes physioloigical response. Hormonal - response in brain
- Situations that induce stress
	1. Novel
	2. Unpredicted / unpredictable
	3. Threating to your personality/ego
	4. Feel like you don't have control over situation
- Languishing behaviours
	- Incapacity to get into action
	- Pre-pandemic at gym eager | now harder to get out of bed
	- Staying home instead of going out - may present as depression-like symptoms
	- Not depression, not burnout - feeling "beige"
	- Way out, don't think - GO!
	- Next time brain is like shoud I shouldn't I - just do it
	- Show up and engage
- Stress Resonance
	- Observation of others experiencing stress/distress elicits same response even if you aren't the one experiencing the stressor
	- Getting away from the source of the stressor often good. Opt for "flight" one of the two main biological stress responses.
- We have been in a lengthy stressful period. Takes as long as the stressor event to return to baseline.
- Be compassionate/ easy on yourself.
- Show up and engage. Don't thing, go. Need energy from others.
- Stress resonates, but so does happiness and calmness in groups
- Opportunity in adversity
